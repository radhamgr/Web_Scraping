      "Wellmet Project, Inc. (www.wellmet.org) is looking for a live-in counselor for our house in Cambridge, with a flexible starting (and move-in) date between November 9 and early December. This is a part time position involving two evenings a week, and does not conflict with having another job during the day. Compensation is room and board: a private room with a lock; food; on-site and free washer and dryer; and utilities, cable and internet. The house is in a very nice neighborhood near Inman square, with plenty of street parking.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are a transitional living program for adults with mental health issues, who are high-functioning and receiving effective treatment. Living together in the house are four staff (three counselors and the Residence Director) and up to 12 residents typically in their 20s to 40s. Counselors are not required to have experience in mental health. The environment is friendly, communal, and generally has the feel of living in a coop or intentional community. The house itself is clean, comfortable, and orderly. Residents are high functioning, work with an extensive treatment team outside the home, and are required to maintain at least 20 hours of day structure per week (via a job, volunteer work, or school). They are also required to perform weekly chores and cooking; expected to be out of the house between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. on weekdays; and must be at the house socializing with other residents for four evenings a week, between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m.\n",
      "\n",
      "Counselors are on duty two nights per week (one weeknight and one weekend night) from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. During an evening shift, the primary duty of counselors is to socialize with residents and foster a fun environment. Social activities usually run until about 9 p.m., after which counselors continue to hang out in a public area and be available to residents as needed until 11 p.m. After 11 p.m., counselors can retire to their room, but are on call overnight for emergencies until 7 a.m. (these are extremely rare and typically involve assistance from the Residence Director). We do our best to ensure boundaries and work-life balance: when they are not on duty (during the day and the other five evenings), counselors are not expected to be available to residents. \n",
      "\n",
      "During their regular evening shifts, counselors are required to work with up to three residents, to help them with their individual goals (for example, finding employment, applying to school, and keeping a budget); perform a weekly chore; and be available to residents for 15-minute check-ins. They are also required to cook dinner (to be served at 6 p.m.) once every two to three weeks (as part of a cooking team of two to three people). Cooking typically begins around 4:30 to 5 p.m., and can be conducted on the same evening that the counselor is on duty.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The available shifts are on Saturday and Monday (6 p.m. to 7 a.m.). Counselors must also be present for weekly staff and house meetings from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Wednesday nights. \n",
      "\n",
      "A Bachelor's degree is required. While experience in mental health is a plus, it is not required and not the norm among staff. People who thrive in this role tend to have a strong sense of community, good boundaries, compassion, and good problem-solving skills. This is a great environment for personal growth. We ask for a one-year commitment from our live-in counselors. For more information, see www.wellmet.org.\n",

      "The Department of Children and Families (DCF) Hotline, operated by Judge Baker Children’s Center (JBCC), is a statewide emergency response system that provides a critical service to ensure the safety and protection of the Commonwealth’s children. The Hotline operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Telephone Screener shifts are primarily from 5:00 pm to 9:00 am , weekends, and holidays.  The Hotline fields over 100,000 calls a year. Hotline staff are trained to assess the urgency of each call, elicit critical information, and initiate an emergency response when children are at imminent risk. We also provide information and referral when needed. The Hotline works in partnership with DCF managers and on-call workers across the state to respond to emergency reports, imminent safety situations and reports of missing or absent children. The newly redesigned Hotline program consists of three units: Child Abuse and Neglect Unit, Missing or Absent Child Unit, and the Hotline Support Unit, which supports DCF with coordinating emergency placements when necessary. \n",
